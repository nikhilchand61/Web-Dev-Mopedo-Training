    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre style="font-family: sans-serif">
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    We don't love anymore
    What was all of it for?
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do

    I just heard you found the one you've been looking
    You've been looking for
    I wish I would have known that wasn't me
    'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
    Why I can't move on
    Just the way you did so easily

    Don't wanna know
    Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
    If he's holding onto you so tight
    The way I did before
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame

    That we don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    We don't love anymore
    What was all of it for?
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do

    I just hope you're lying next to somebody
    Who knows how to love you like me
    There must be a good reason that you're gone
    Every now and then I think you might want me to
    Come show up at your door
    But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

    Don't wanna know
    If you're looking into her eyes
    If she's holding onto you so tight
    The way I did before
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame

    That we don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    We don't love anymore
    What was all of it for?
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do

    Like we used to do

    Don't wanna know
    Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
    If he's giving it to you just right
    The way I did before
    I overdosed
    Should've known your love was a game
    Now I can't get you out of my brain
    Oh, it's such a shame

    That we don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    We don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do
    We don't love anymore
    What was all of it for?
    Oh, we don't talk anymore
    Like we used to do

    We don't talk anymore (don't wanna know)
    Kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)
    If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)
    The way I did before
    We don't talk anymore (I overdosed)
    Should've known your love was a game (oh)
    Now I can't get you out of my brain (whoa)
    Oh, it's such a shame

    That we don't talk anymore
